# InstaNews
Project #2

InstaNews uses API from New York Times for displaying current events.
For this project, I used JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and API.
To style this HTML, I used SASS.

## What I've learnt from this project:

I've learnt to be more organized with code using SASS and using folders, while honed my skill to use JavaScript and jQuery. 
This project is mobile & tablet friendly!
